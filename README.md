Vue directive that helps you appear stuff as it comes into view.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Install with your preffered package manager:

```bash
npm install --save vue-appear
# or
yarn add vue-appear
```

### Setup

Once installed register the plugin with [Vue]:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueAppear from 'vue-appear'

Vue.use(VueAppear)
```

If you wish to override default settings you can pass in the options as a second argument:

```js
Vue.use(VueAppear, {
  immediate: false,
  toggle: false,
  children: false,
  offset: 150,
  hook: 'onEnter',
  delay: 0,
  class: 'appear',
  selector: null,
  callback: () => {}
})
```

### Usage in templates

```html
<!-- Appear once element comes into view -->
<div v-appear></div>

<!-- Appear immediately -->
<div v-appear.immediate></div>

<!-- Toggle apperance as they come into view, and leave -->
<div v-appear.toggle></div>

<!-- Appear children as they come into view -->
<div v-appear.children>
  <h4>Title</h4>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sin</p>
</div>

<!-- Combine modifiers as you wish -->
<div v-appear.toggle.children>
  <h4>Title</h4>

</div>

<!-- Pass in additional options -->
